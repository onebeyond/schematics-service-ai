# schematics-service-ai

This repo implements as a schematics a fully operational service setup.

This service is intended to be used as a template to cover 80% of the projects that requires some kind of AI support.

It has been implemented using Typescript and NestJS in order to be as much as standard as possible.

### How to use the schematics locally?

1. Ensure you're using node 20 (just run `nvm use`)
2. Run the generate command (`npm run generate`) and follow the instructions.

That's it!

### How to test it?

Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

### How to collaborate with it?

There is no a defined way to collaborate, but if you want to add new features to the service, you can generate the service locally, update it and test your changes, bring changes to the schematics and do a PR to this repository. :wink:

### How to publish it?
